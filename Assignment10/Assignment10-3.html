<p class = email> EMAIL: <br>As Andre's lawyer and personal/professional quality control, I highly doubt you will find any information about the artist's personal affairs on this page. Unfortunately, this is due to the personal wishes of the artist. </br></p>

<p class = address> ADDRESS: <br>Again, no one knows where the artist resides, and with critics on the rise, no one wants any unnecessary risks.</br></p>
